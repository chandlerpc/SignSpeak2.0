## Introduction Script

Hi, ___________! My name is ___________, and I'm going to be walking you through this session today.

Before we begin, I want to thank you for taking the time to help us test this application. Your feedback is extremely valuable and will help us improve the user experience.

**What we're doing today:**

We're testing a web application called SignSpeak that translates American Sign Language (ASL) finger-spelling in real-time using your webcam. Today we're going to ask you to try doing some typical tasks with this application so we can see where we need to improve it.

**How this works:**

I'm going to ask you to complete some tasks using the application. While you're working, I'm going to ask you to think out loud - to say what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will help us understand what's working well and what isn't.

**A few important things:**

- We're testing the application, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. If you have difficulty with something, that means we need to improve it.
- Please don't worry about hurting our feelings. We want honest feedback. The more candid you are, the more we'll learn.
- If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people use the application when they don't have someone sitting next to them. But I'll try to answer any questions you have after we're done.
- You'll be working with a real application, so some things might not work exactly as expected. That's okay - that's what we're here to find out.

**Recording:**

With your permission, we're going to record your screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the application, and it won't be seen by anyone except the people working on this project. It also helps me, because I don't have to take as many notes.

**Do I have your permission to record your screen and our conversation?**
☐ Yes ☐ No

**Any questions before we start?**

## Preliminary Questions

Before we look at the application, I'd like to ask you a few quick questions:

1. Have you ever used or learned American Sign Language (ASL)?
   - If yes: How would you describe your skill level?

2. Have you ever used any assistive technology or translation apps before?
   - If yes: Which ones?

3. How often do you use web applications that require webcam access?
   - (e.g., video calls, filters, AR experiences)

4. What device and browser are you using today?

5. Are you comfortable with the application accessing your webcam for this test?

2. **Perform a real-time finger-spelling translation**
3. **Use Practice Mode to learn and practice ASL finger-spelling**
4. **Access the ASL alphabet reference guide**
5. **Save a translated phrase for later use**
6. **View performance analytics and history**

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Getting Started with SignSpeak

**Context:** You've heard about an app that can translate ASL finger-spelling using your webcam, and you want to try it out for the first time. You're curious to see how it works and want to get the camera set up.

**Your task:** Open the SignSpeak application and get the camera working so you can see yourself on screen with hand detection enabled.

---

### Scenario 2: Communicating a Message

**Context:** You want to use SignSpeak to translate a simple message. You know basic finger-spelling and want to see if the application can accurately recognize the letters you're signing. You want to spell out the word "HELLO".

**Your task:** Use the application to finger-spell the word "HELLO" and see if it correctly translates your signs.

---

### Scenario 3: Learning ASL Finger-Spelling

**Context:** You're interested in learning ASL finger-spelling, and you've heard that SignSpeak has a practice mode that can help you learn. You want to use this feature to practice signing different letters and get feedback on your accuracy.

**Your task:** Find and use the Practice Mode feature to practice signing letters. Try to complete at least 3 practice attempts and see how well you're doing.

---

### Scenario 4: Finding Sign References

**Context:** While practicing, you realize you're not sure how to properly form certain ASL letters with your hand. You need a reference guide to check the correct hand positions for the alphabet.

**Your task:** Find a way to view the ASL alphabet reference guide while you're in Practice Mode.

---

### Scenario 5: Saving Important Phrases

**Context:** You've successfully translated a phrase that you want to remember and use again later. The phrase is "MY NAME IS [your name]". You'd like to save this phrase so you can easily access it in the future.

**Your task:** Translate and save the phrase "MY NAME IS [your name]" for future reference.
